Run_me

In this script the experiment setup can be determined, which can depend on several factors:
Map: The map gives a graphical display of the aircraft. For testing purposes the map is turned off, to increase simulator speed.
max_number: This sets the amount of aicraft in the airspace at the same time. This can have multiple values when testing at multiple setups.
t_simulated: The equivalent time the simulator runs in seconds.
dt: timestep of the simulator in seconds. When using the map it is recommended to use a value between 0.1 and 2.0.
area: This sets the area of the airspace. This can have multiple values when testing at multiple setups, but should have at least the same list length as max_number.
marge and Za: These are values to determine the stop criteria.
